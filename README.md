# Groundfog Training

A few notes before we begin:

- custom plugins are contained in the `packages` folder of each topic branch
- this repository is organized in topic branches, to help you navigate the examples by workshop topic
- each presenter will inform you which branch they're working on, so you can switch accordingly

## Project Setup
